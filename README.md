# vue-js boilerplate

You can check [Vue 2.0 boilerplate ](https://github.com/mrpehlivan/vue-2.0-boilerplate) . Because this project is old.

For quick startup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrpehlivan/vuejs-boilerplate.git
cd vuejs-boilerplate
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage
Make sure Node installed. I recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage versions. 

#### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### Run devlopment tasks:
```
npm start
```
Aliases: `npm run gulp`, `npm run development`

This is where the magic happens. The perfect front-end workflow. This runs the default gulp task, which starts compiling, watching, and live updating all our files as we change them. BrowserSync will start a server on port 3000, or do whatever you've configured it to do. You'll be able to see live changes in all connected browsers. Don't forget about the additional BrowserSync tools available on port 3001!

#### Run api tasks: 
```
npm run api
```

#### Run in tests in watch mode:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

#### Run tests once:
```bash
npm run test
```

#### Build production files:
```bash
npm run production
```
